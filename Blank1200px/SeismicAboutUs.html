	<p class= "aboutp" ><img src="SEISMIC SOUND OFFICIAL LOGO.PNG" alt="RB black">When it comes to Seismic Entertainment it’s nothing but good vibes, love and happiness. We want you to have memories when you're wedding is over. We want you to look back in later years and say I’m so glad I hired Seismic Entertainment for my wedding. When it comes to your reception we want to make sure that you celebrate the new journey that you going to take on with you're spouse. We want you to end the night with your feet tired and drained because of how much you were constantly moving. We want you guess to come to you and tell how they had a wonderful night because of the music. We want you singing and dancing all night long until you tell us we have to go home now. Like our slogan says, "memories are made on the dance floor." </p>
		
	<p>Seismic Entertainment is a multiple genre group, we play for any culture and any event, Proms, weddings, birthday parties, quinceaneras, bat mitzvah, etc. We provided the best and cleanest music. We provide a lot of different packages for your event. As you would see when we send out our contract, you provide different packages from lights, photo booths, TV’s whatever you like we have it. We want to insure that you have the best time for your event. Depending on your event we can also provide video and picture personals, also provide a MC or a host for any event. First we send our contract and you fill it and then after we receive the contract back we will call you for any last questions we have or you may have for your event to finalize everything. Then when that is over and finalized we take a 50% deposit of the final price and the other half later after the event is over. Cause again “memories are made on the Dance Floor.”
